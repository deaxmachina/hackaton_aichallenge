### Data Notes 
<ul>
  <li>
    The reporting period of the data is not the same for all the countries. Some had data for more than 3 years, and some only 1-2; these years were not always the same for all the cities, making an exact comparison between all cities challenging. However, the majority of the data was for the 5-year period 2013-2017. There are 6 cities with 5 or more years of data, 22 cities with 4 or more years, 67 cities with 3 or more and 144 cities with 2 or more. 
  </li>
  <li>
    A few cities, such as Australia, were categorised in more than one region. When that was the case, only the data for one of the regions was taken; it is possible than by doing so some of the data was omitted. 
  </li>
  <li>
    For the visualisation cities with at least 2 records were selected.
