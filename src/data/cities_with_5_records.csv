Recently the City has also developed GPC BASIC inventories for the 2005/06, 2013/14 and 2014/15 years to be compliant with the Compact of Mayors. The GPC BASIC inventories show lower emissions compared with inventories based on the CCAP tool due to different methodologies and emissions sources. Future yearâ€™s reports may be subject to change as the City of Sydney will be updating its inventories in the short term for achieving beyond GPC BASIC compliance.",Sydney,Australia,South Asia and Oceania,"(-33.8674869, 151.2069902)"
