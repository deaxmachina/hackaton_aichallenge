Fuel oil use was provided by private fuel oil suppliers, per Local Law 43 of 2013, which requires fuel oil providers to report fuel oil deliveries by fuel type to the City on an annual basis. The New York Metropolitan Transportation Council (NYMTC) provided on-road transportation vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT) data. Energy use data for public transit were provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) for New York City Transit (NYCT) subways and buses, Staten Island Railway (SIR), MTA Metro-North Rail Road (MNR) and Long Island Railroad (LIRR) commuter rail, and MTA Bus Company buses; by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) for Trans-Hudson (PATH) commuter rail; and New Jersey Transit (NJT) for its commuter rail and buses. Data used to calculate fugitive and process CH4 and process N2O from wastewater treatment were provided by DEP. CH4 emissions were calculated based on the destruction of volatile material in anaerobic digesters. Based on the measured concentration and flow of volatile organic solids, it is estimated that 15 cubic feet of digester gas is produced for every pound of volatile organic solids destroyed. N2O emissions were calculated by applying the daily nitrogen load discharged by each of the City’s 14 wastewater treatment plant to the formula in the LGOP. Fugitive CH4 from in-city landfills was calculated from landfill gas collection data provided by the New York City Department of Sani- tation (DSNY) and DEP per the LGOP. Fugitive CH4 from exported solid waste was calculated using waste disposal figures for resi- dential, commercial, and construction and demolition waste and applying emissions factors from the USCP, which were taken from EPA’s Waste Reduction Model (WARM). Fugitive CH4 from natural gas distribution was calculated using data provided by National Grid and ConEd.

New GHG methodologies and standards that were not available for previous analyses will be evaluated and adopted for future GHG emissions inventories, as-appropriate. The following GHG protocols were used in the 2010 Regional GHG Inventory: The LGOP for Greenhouse Gas Assessments developed by ICLEI, CAR, TCR and CARB (California Air Resources Board 2010a): This protocol includes methods for estimating emissions resulting from government buildings and facilities, government fleet vehicles, wastewater treatment and potable water treatment facilities, landfill and composting facilities, and other operations. This protocol was developed primarily for use by California local governments; although it contains methodologies for estimating emissions pertinent to community emissions sources. Further, this protocol can be modified for use outside of California, although in some cases, data sources or other references may need to be modified accordingly to local conditions or constraints. The USEPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2007 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009a): The national inventory documentation includes standard methodology and emission factors for nationwide GHG emissions inventorying. The IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006a): This document is the international standard for inventories and provides much of the baseline methodology used in the national and statewide emission inventories. The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard developed by WRI and the WBCSD (World Resources Institute 2004): Although this is a protocol designed for use primarily by private corporations, it was one of the first documents to establish the principles and steps to developing a GHG inventory.

Residential Sector: disaggregated according to electrified and non-electrified by income category. Commercial Sector: including retail and office buildings, tourism activities, education facilities, hospitals, and other non-industrial activities. Industrial Sector: disaggregated into textiles, food and beverages, non-food manufacturing sub-sectors and other industrial activities.

Transport Sector: disaggregated into freight, private vehicle and public transport (bus,minibus taxi and train) The City's GHG account/inventory for its most recent State of Energy Report (Report released in 2015 based on 2012 data year) is based on the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Draft v2 (GPC). Emissions factors draw on those of the IPCC (web based and regularly updated) for South Africa, as well as Eskom for local electricity emissions factors. In the Cape Town GPC summary table provided, Scope 1 includes all emissions that physically take place within the Cape Town area. This includes liquid fuels consumed and coal. Even if that liquid fuel is moved out of the area, it is still accounted for as per point of sale. This scope includes the emissions from Ankerlig and Acacia power stations (Energy supplied to the grid - territorial); but these are removed in the final balance for Cape Town as per protocol (this is accounted for within national electricity production accounts of Eskom). Scope 2 includes emissions from electricity produced elsewhere in the country, but consumed in Cape Town. This column accounts for the majority of these emissions, but a small portion are recorded in Scope 3, reflecting that component of the emissions factor that relates to Transmission and distribution (i.e. from power station to municipal boundary; and amounting to 0.04 of the 1.03 emissions factor).

GHG emissions for electricity consumption - The indirect CO2 emissions per electricity consumption were calculated taking into account the average emission factor of the National Interconnected System in each year of the period considered. GHG emissions per treatment and release of liquid effluents - Belo Horizonte has 4 sewage treatment plants (STP) in operation, which are emitting methane and nitrous oxide.There are a fifth STP that employs physicolchemical processes that do not emit greenhouse gases. A fraction of sewage collected in Belo Horizonte is not forwarded to any treatment plant, being deposited directly into the water body; another fraction of wastewater, which is not collected, it is presumably treated in septic systems (septic tanks), followed by infiltration. GHG emissions by treating municipal solid waste - Landfill - The solids waste generated in Belo Horizonte are taken for disposal in landfill (CTR Macaúbas), where there is no biogas recovery system. It was assumed that 100% of the biogas generated in massive municipal solid waste is released into the atmosphere. A fraction of the waste collected in the city is still willing to massive treatment center CTR-BR-040 in Belo Horizonte, in a separate area where, from 2010, began a system of thermoelectric generation from biogas generated at the landfill. Thus, biogas derived from the ancient massive waste should not be considered in the GHG inventory from 2010. Is it considered only the fraction derived from the provisions in recent separate area and not covered by biogas recovery system. It is worth mentioning that according to this model first-order decay, For purposes of this inventory, we adopted a period of 10 (ten) years as horizon degradation of waste within the massif.
