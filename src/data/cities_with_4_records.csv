All data provided in this CDP submission is based on this report. The process includes: A baseline data collection was collected from the following 5 sectors. Residential Sector: disaggregated according to electrified and non-electrified by income category. Commercial Sector: including retail and office buildings, tourism activities, education facilities, hospitals, and other non-industrial activities. Industrial Sector: disaggregated into textiles, food and beverages, non-food manufacturing sub-sectors and other industrial activities. Local Government: all municipal operations, namely council buildings, street and traffic lights, water and wastewater treatment works and municipal vehicle fleet. Transport Sector: disaggregated into freight, private vehicle and public transport (bus,minibus taxi and train) The City's GHG account/inventory for its most recent State of Energy Report (Report released in 2015 based on 2012 data year) is based on the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Draft v2 (GPC). Emissions factors draw on those of the IPCC (web based and regularly updated) for South Africa, as well as Eskom for local electricity emissions factors. In the Cape Town GPC summary table provided, Scope 1 includes all emissions that physically take place within the Cape Town area. This includes liquid fuels consumed and coal. Even if that liquid fuel is moved out of the area, it is still accounted for as per point of sale. This scope includes the emissions from Ankerlig and Acacia power stations (Energy supplied to the grid - territorial); but these are removed in the final balance for Cape Town as per protocol (this is accounted for within national electricity production accounts of Eskom). Scope 2 includes emissions from electricity produced elsewhere in the country, but consumed in Cape Town. This column accounts for the majority of these emissions, but a small portion are recorded in Scope 3, reflecting that component of the emissions factor that relates to Transmission and distribution (i.e. from power station to municipal boundary; and amounting to 0.04 of the 1.03 emissions factor).

Recently the City has also developed GPC BASIC inventories for the 2005/06, 2013/14 and 2014/15 years to be compliant with the Compact of Mayors. The GPC BASIC inventories show lower emissions compared with inventories based on the CCAP tool due to different methodologies and emissions sources. Future year’s reports may be subject to change as the City of Sydney will be updating its inventories in the short term for achieving beyond GPC BASIC compliance.",Sydney,Australia,South Asia and Oceania,"(-33.8674869, 151.2069902)"

These concentrations were considered in the calculations and applied to the total of each fuel checked for the municipality, according to regulatory developments in the industry. GHG emissions for electricity consumption - The indirect CO2 emissions per electricity consumption were calculated taking into account the average emission factor of the National Interconnected System in each year of the period considered. GHG emissions per treatment and release of liquid effluents - Belo Horizonte has 4 sewage treatment plants (STP) in operation, which are emitting methane and nitrous oxide.There are a fifth STP that employs physicolchemical processes that do not emit greenhouse gases. A fraction of sewage collected in Belo Horizonte is not forwarded to any treatment plant, being deposited directly into the water body; another fraction of wastewater, which is not collected, it is presumably treated in septic systems (septic tanks), followed by infiltration. GHG emissions by treating municipal solid waste - Landfill - The solids waste generated in Belo Horizonte are taken for disposal in landfill (CTR Macaúbas), where there is no biogas recovery system. It was assumed that 100% of the biogas generated in massive municipal solid waste is released into the atmosphere. A fraction of the waste collected in the city is still willing to massive treatment center CTR-BR-040 in Belo Horizonte, in a separate area where, from 2010, began a system of thermoelectric generation from biogas generated at the landfill. Thus, biogas derived from the ancient massive waste should not be considered in the GHG inventory from 2010. Is it considered only the fraction derived from the provisions in recent separate area and not covered by biogas recovery system. It is worth mentioning that according to this model first-order decay, For purposes of this inventory, we adopted a period of 10 (ten) years as horizon degradation of waste within the massif. Composting - BH also conducts composting for organic waste. These activities take place in the CTRS Rod BR-040 and may incur nitrous oxide and methane.",Belo Horizonte,Brazil,Latin America,"(-19.916681, -43.934493)"

This means that scope 3 emissions from transport of inhabitants outside the community boundary is not included (but transport of non-inhabitants within the community boundary is). Emission from household waste incineration is embedded in the district heating emissions, since household waste is a source of energy used in district heating. Energy use for waste-water handling is included in the total community energy use. Emission factors are collected from a report published by Swedish Environmental Research Institute Ltd. (IVL) in 2001 and Thermal Engineering Research Institute (Värmeforsk) in 2011. The reports are widely used and acknowledged. The global warming potentials are GWP100 from IPCC 2007, as recommended by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA). Energy statistics are collected from different sources: district heating & gas statistics are collected from the companies; electricity statistics is compiled and collected from Statistics Sweden; emissions from road transport is modeled using an extensive emission model combined with a road model over Stockholm (includes a variety vehicles, speeds, road types etc) and non-road emissions are taken from Statistics Sweden; marine emissions within the community boundary are based on emissions & energy use presented in environmental reports from shipping companies and Ports of Stockholm.",Stockholm,Sweden,Europe,"(59.3293235, 18.0685808)"
